{"D245A (Title)":"Inspiratory resistance delays the reporting of symptoms with central hypovolemia: association with cerebral blood flow","D520B (Abstract)":"We tested the hypothesis that breathing through an inspiratory threshold device (ITD) during progressive central hypovolemia would protect cerebral perfusion and attenuate the reporting of presyncopal symptoms. Eight human subjects were exposed to lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) until the presence of symptoms while breathing through either an active ITD (-7 cmH(2)O impedance) or a sham ITD (0 cmH(2)O). Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured continuously via transcranial Doppler and analyzed in both time and frequency domains. Subjects were asked to report any subjective presyncopal symptoms (e.g., dizziness, nausea) at the conclusion of each LBNP exposure. Symptoms were coincident with physiological evidence of cardiovascular collapse (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia). Breathing on the active ITD increased LBNP tolerance time (mean +\/- SE) from 2,014 +\/- 106 s to 2,259 +\/- 138 s (P = 0.006). We compared CBFV responses at the time of symptoms during the sham ITD trial with those at the same absolute time during the active ITD trial (when there were no symptoms). While there was no difference in mean CBFV at these time points (sham, 44 +\/- 4 cm\/s vs. active, 47 +\/- 4; P = 0.587), total oscillations (sum of high- and low-frequency spectral power) of CBFV were higher (P = 0.004) with the active ITD (45.6 +\/- 10.2 cm\/s(2)) than the sham ITD (22.1 +\/- 5.4 cm\/s(2)). We conclude that greater oscillations around the same absolute level of mean CBFV are induced by inspiratory resistance and may contribute to the delay in symptoms and cardiovascular collapse that accompany progressive central hypovolemia.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["BLOOD CIRCULATION","BLOOD FLOW","BRAIN CIRCULATION","HYPOVOLEMIA","SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["ADULTS","BLOOD VOLUME","SYNCOPE","CARDIAC OUTPUT","ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY","FEMALES","HEART RATE","LOWER BODY NEGATIVE PRESSURE","MALES","STATISTICAL ANALYSIS","STROKE VOLUME"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":["Airway Resistance\/physiology","Cerebrovascular Circulation\/physiology","Hypovolemia\/physiopathology"],"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":["Adult","Blood Volume\/physiology","Stroke Volume\/physiology","Syncope\/physiopathology","Cardiac Output\/physiology","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Electrocardiography","Female","Heart Rate\/physiology","Humans","Lower Body Negative Pressure","Male"],"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":["Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S"],"D072B (Subject Category)":["AEROSPACE MEDICINE"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

An elliptical shaped spin valve at deep submicron dimension is modeled. It is found that stable spin waves with extremely narrow linewidth are excited in the free layer when the perpendicularly injected direct current is slightly above a threshold. The spin transfer effect yields self leveling of the generated spin waves and results in spin waves with stable amplitude for each excited mode. At high current level, the excited spin waves become chaotic in nature, causing a pronounced 1\/f-like spectral content in the magnetoresistive output.

Our aim is to describe both the quasiparticlelike excitations and the locally critical modes observed in various physical situations, including non-Fermi-liquid behavior in heavy-fermion systems in the vicinity of a quantum critical point. We carry out an analysis of the strong-coupling fixed point, from which an effective Hamiltonian is derived containing both a charge interaction and a spin coupling between n(sub d) nearest-neighbor electrons and the screened impurity. The effective charge interaction is already present in the case of a purely fermionic impurity and it changes from repulsive to attractive at q=N\/2, due to the q[right arrow]N-q symmetry. The sign of the effective spin coupling determines the stability of the strong-coupling fixed point. Already in the single-channel case and in contrast with either the pure bosonic or the pure fermionic case, the strong-coupling fixed point is unstable against the conduction electron kinetic term in the large-N limit as soon as q>N\/2. The origin of this change of regime is directly related to the sign of the effective charge interaction.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["ABRIKOSOV THEORY","BOSONS","CRITICAL POINT","ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS","FERMIONS","HEAVY FERMION SYSTEMS","KONDO EFFECT","MAGNETIC MOMENTS"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":null,"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":["Kondo effect","fermion systems","boson systems","quasiparticles","heavy fermion systems","critical points","magnetic transitions","SU(N) theory"],"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["SOLID-STATE PHYSICS"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

This cyclic shear loading created a decrease in pull-out strength for both screw types of approximately 11% (p less than 0.01). No statistically significant difference in pull-out strength was found between screw types either before or after cyclic loading. A linear relationship between pull-out force and cortical thickness was observed for both screw types. These tests corroborated past work which showed equal holding power for the self-tapping and non-self-tapping screw. The progressive loosening of the screws with cyclic shear loading was accompanied by increasing load-displacement hysteresis and screw head migration. Greater hysteresis suggested that the non-self-tapping screw might have loosened more than the self-tapping screw from this applied loading schedule. Bone microcracking around screw threads before and after cyclic loading was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Photomicrographs of one non-self-tapping screw type and two self-tapping screw types showed microcracks at the tip of the outer diameter of the screw thread. More microcracks were observed after application of cyclic shear loading.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["BONES","IN VITRO METHODS AND TESTS","SCREWS"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["METHODOLOGY"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":["Bone Screws"],"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":["Human","Methods"],"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["LIFE SCIENCES (GENERAL)"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

In OMC-1, the rotational temperature of ethyl cyanide is 90 K (in good agreement with other molecules), the local-standard-of-rest radial velocity is 4.5 + or - 1.0 km\/s (versus 8.5 km\/s for most molecules), and the column density is 1.8 by 10 to the 14th power per sq cm (a surprisingly high figure for a complicated molecule).

The host is a slightly evolved late F-star likely in the very short-lived \"blue-hook\" stage of evolution, with T eff = 6148 [plus-or-minus] 48 K, log g = 4.030+0.015 - 0.026 and [Fe\/H] = 0.034 [plus-or-minus] 0.78. The inferred stellar mass is M * = 1.314+0.063 - 0.060 M [dot in circle, solar] and the star has a relatively large radius of R * = 1.836+0.066 - 0.046 R [dot in circle, solar]. The planet is a typical hot Jupiter with period 4.1137913 [plus-or-minus] 0.00001 days and a mass of MP = 1.524 [plus-or-minus] 0.088 M J and radius of RP = 1.290+0.064 - 0.050 R J. This is mildly inflated as compared to models of irradiated giant planets at the [approx]4 Gyr age of the system. KELT-2A is the third brightest star with a transiting planet identified by ground-based transit surveys, and the ninth brightest star overall with a transiting planet. KELT-2Ab's mass and radius are unique among the subset of planets with V < 9 host stars, and therefore increases the diversity of bright benchmark systems. We also measure the relative motion of KELT-2A and -2B over a baseline of 38 years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that the stars are bound. This allows us to infer that KELT-2B is an early K dwarf. We hypothesize that through the eccentric Kozai mechanism KELT-2B may have emplaced KELT-2Ab in its current orbit.

Model properties and predicted trends","D520B (Abstract)":"DNA is constantly damaged through endogenous processes and by exogenous agents, such as ionizing radiation. Base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) help maintain the stability of the genome by removing many different types of DNA damage. We present a Monte Carlo excision repair (MCER) model that simulates key steps in the short-patch and long-patch BER pathways and the NER pathway. The repair of both single and clustered damages, except double-strand breaks (DSBs), is simulated in the MCER model.

The numerical methodology was based on a finite-volume formulation in complex 3D geometries and utilization of colocated variables and Cartesian velocity components.

An axial velocity at the center point of the cross-plane increases with increasing axial distance from the inlet plane, and yields the fully developed value far from the inlet. The cross-stream flow becomes weaker as the axial distance increases and is diminished far from the inlet plane.

{"D245A (Title)":"Characterization of Transport Errors in Chemical Forecasts from a Global Tropospheric Chemical Transport Model","D520B (Abstract)":"We propose a new methodology to characterize errors in the representation of transport processes in chemical transport models. We constrain the evaluation of a global three-dimensional chemical transport model (GEOS-CHEM) with an extended dataset of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations obtained during the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) aircraft campaign. The TRACEP mission took place over the western Pacific, a region frequently impacted by continental outflow associated with different synoptic-scale weather systems (such as cold fronts) and deep convection, and thus provides a valuable dataset. for our analysis. Model simulations using both forecast and assimilated meteorology are examined. Background CO concentrations are computed as a function of latitude and altitude and subsequently subtracted from both the observed and the model datasets to focus on the ability of the model to simulate variability on a synoptic scale. Different sampling strategies (i.e., spatial displacement and smoothing) are applied along the flight tracks to search for systematic model biases. Statistical quantities such as correlation coefficient and centered root-mean-square difference are computed between the simulated and the observed fields and are further inter-compared using Taylor diagrams. We find no systematic bias in the model for the TRACE-P region when we consider the entire dataset (i.e., from the surface to 12 km ). This result indicates that the transport error in our model is globally unbiased, which has important implications for using the model to conduct inverse modeling studies. Using the First-Look assimilated meteorology only provides little improvement of the correlation, in comparison with the forecast meteorology. These general statements can be refined when the entire dataset is divided into different vertical domains, i.e., the lower troposphere (less than 2 km), the middle troposphere (2-6 km), and the upper troposphere (greater than 6 km). The best agreement between the observations and the model is found in the lower and middle troposphere. Downward displacements in the lower troposphere provide a better fit with the observed value, which could indicate a problem in the representation of boundary layer height in the model. Significant improvement is also found for downward and southward displacements in the upper troposphere. There are several potential sources of errors in our simulation of the continental outflow in the upper troposphere which could lead to such biases, including the location and\/or the strength of deep convective cells as well as that of wildfires in Southeast Asia.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["TROPOSPHERE","THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELS","CHARACTERIZATION","TRANSPORT THEORY","ERROR ANALYSIS","CHEMICAL EVOLUTION","GEOSAT SATELLITES"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["CARBON MONOXIDE","DATA ACQUISITION","CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS","SOUTHEAST ASIA","ANNUAL VARIATIONS","BIOMASS BURNING","ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERRORS","SIMULATION"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["GEOPHYSICS"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":"Distribution as joint owner in the copyright","Availabiliity Note":null}

{"D245A (Title)":"Modulation of Dickkopf-1 attenuates glucocorticoid induction of osteoblast apoptosis, adipocytic differentiation, and bone mass loss","D520B (Abstract)":"Long-term glucocorticoid treatment impairs the survival and bone formation of osteogenic cells, leading to bone mass loss. The Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) acts as a potent bone-remodeling factor that mediates several types of skeletal disorders. Whereas excess glucocorticoid is known to disturb Wnt signaling in osteogenic cells, modulation of the skeletally deleterious effects of DKK1 to alleviate glucocorticoid induction of bone loss has not been tested. In this study, knockdown of DKK1 expression by end-capped phosphorothioate DKK1 antisense oligonucleotide (DKK1-AS) abrogated dexamethasone suppression of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Exogenous DKK1-AS treatment alleviated dexamethasone suppression of mineral density, trabecular bone volume, osteoblast surface, and bone formation rate in bone tissue and ex vivo osteogenesis of primary bone-marrow mesenchymal cells. The DKK1-AS inhibited adipocyte volume in the marrow cavity of steroid-treated bone tissue. Immunohistochemical observation revealed that DKK1-AS abrogated dexamethasone-induced DKK1 expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling of osteoblasts adjacent to trabecular bone. Knocking down DKK1 abrogated dexamethasone-modulated expression of nuclear beta-catenin and phosphorylated Ser(473)-Akt and survival of osteoblasts and adipocytic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cell cultures. Taken together, knocking down DKK1 alleviated the deleterious effect of glucocorticoid on bone microstructure. The DKK1-AS treatment appeared to protect bone tissue by modulating beta-catenin and Akt-mediated survival as well as the osteogenic and adipogenic activities of glucocorticoid-stressed osteoprogenitor cells. Interference with the osteogenesis-inhibitory action of DKK1 has therapeutic potential for preventing glucocorticoid induction of osteopenia.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["ADIPOSE TISSUES","APOPTOSIS","OSTEOBLASTS","BONE DEMINERALIZATION","BONES","DISEASES","GLUCOCORTICOIDS","HORMONE METABOLISMS","HORMONES","METABOLIC DISEASES","MODULATION"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["CYTOLOGY","DIFFERENTIATION (BIOLOGY)","GENETICS","MALES","MICE","OLIGONUCLEOTIDES","OSTEOGENESIS","RATS"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":["Adipocytes\/cytology","Apoptosis\/drug effects","Bone Diseases, Metabolic\/prevention &amp","control","Dexamethasone\/pharmacology","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins\/genetics\/physiology","Osteoblasts\/cytology\/drug effects"],"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":["Animals","Cell Differentiation\/drug effects","beta Catenin\/physiology","In Situ Nick-End Labeling","Male","Mice","Oligonucleotides, Antisense\/pharmacology","Osteogenesis","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt\/physiology","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley"],"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"],"D072B (Subject Category)":["AEROSPACE MEDICINE"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

These curves are qualitatively interpreted much like standard Schlumberger resistivity sounding curves. Final interpretation made use of a layered earth Marquardt inversion computer program. The results combined with those from a set of Schlumberger soundings in the area show that there is a moderately resistive basement at a depth no greater than 800 meters.

{"D245A (Title)":"Supersonic CO laser with RF excitation","D520B (Abstract)":"A supersonic CO laser with a maximum output power of 990 W was developed. The gas is excited in a dielectrically stabilized radio-frequency discharge before it is cooled to a temperature of 90 K by the adiabatic expansion in a supersonic nozzle. After extraction of laser power the gas is recompressed by a supersonic diffuser and a Roots-pump system. No liquid nitrogen is needed for the operation of the laser. At a pressure of 500 mbar, the RF discharge could be operated homogeneously with a specific input power of 180 W\/cu cm. It could be shown that the length of the discharge region and the distance between the discharge and the supersonic nozzle should be rather short. By this, the vibrational relaxation of the carbon monoxide is reduced and more laser power can be obtained. The laser power can be increased by using a folded resonator system. If the laser is operated at a low Fresnel number by inserting an aperture inside the cavity, a nearly diffraction limited beam quality can be obtained. Using a supersonic nozzle with a low Mach number enables the operation of the diffuser with a high pressure recovery. Thereby the overall system efficiency is increased.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["CARBON MONOXIDE LASERS","CRYOGENIC COOLING","RADIO FREQUENCY DISCHARGE","SUPERSONIC NOZZLES"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["CAVITY RESONATORS","LASER OUTPUTS","MOLECULAR RELAXATION","PULSED LASERS","VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["LASERS AND MASERS"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

The c-fos m-RNA expression was found in the MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in both normal medium (control group) and low Ca medium (low Ca groups). The degree of expression was significantly higher in the low Ca group than in the control group in each treatment period (p < 0.01) and in both groups, after the treatment with FBS or EGF, the expression levels increased with time at 5 and 10 minutes but decreased at 15 minutes. Thereafter, levels increased again to reach to a maximum at 30 minutes after which it decreased rapidly. On the other hand, in both groups, after the treatment with EGF, the expression increased at 30 minute.

{"D245A (Title)":"Underdetermined blind source separation using sparse representations","D520B (Abstract)":"The scope of this work is the separation of N sources from M linear mixtures when the underlying system is underdetermined, that is, when M<N. If the input distribution is sparse the mixing matrix can be estimated either by external optimization or by clustering and, given the mixing matrix, a minimal l sub(1) norm representation of the sources can be obtained by solving a low-dimensional linear programming problem for each of the data points. Yet, when the signals per se do not satisfy this assumption, sparsity can still be achieved by realizing the separation in a sparser transformed domain. The approach is illustrated here for M=2. In this case we estimate both the number of sources and the mixing matrix by the maxima of a potential function along the circle of unit length, and we obtain the minimal l sub(1) norm representation of each data point by a linear combination of the pair of basis vectors that enclose it. Several experiments with music and speech signals show that their time-domain representation is not sparse enough. Yet, excellent results were obtained using their short-time Fourier transform, including the separation of up to six sources from two mixtures. copyright 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This review summarizes our experience with physiologic deformational loading of chondrocyte-seeded agarose hydrogels to promote development of cartilage constructs having mechanical properties matching that of the parent calf tissue, which has a Young's modulus E(Y) = 277 kPa and unconfined dynamic modulus at 1 Hz G* = 7 MPa. Over an 8-week culture period, cartilage-like properties have been achieved for 60 x 10(6) cells\/ml seeding density agarose constructs, with E(Y) = 186 kPa, G* = 1.64 MPa. For these constructs, the GAG content reached 1.74% ww and collagen content 2.64% ww compared to 2.4% ww and 21.5% ww for the parent tissue, respectively. Issues regarding the deformational loading protocol, cell-seeding density, nutrient supply, growth factor addition, and construct mechanical characterization are discussed. In anticipation of cartilage repair studies, we also describe early efforts to engineer cylindrical and anatomically shaped bilayered constructs of agarose hydrogel and bone (i.e., osteochondral constructs). The presence of a bony substrate may facilitate integration upon implantation. These efforts will provide an underlying framework from which a functional tissue-engineering approach, as described by Butler and coworkers (2000), may be applied to general cell-scaffold systems adopted for cartilage tissue engineering.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["BIOREACTORS","CARTILAGE","CYTOLOGY","LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY","PHYSIOLOGY","TISSUE CULTURING","TISSUE ENGINEERING","TISSUES (BIOLOGY)"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["ALGORITHMS","CATTLE","CELL DIVISION","CULTURED CELLS","ELASTIC PROPERTIES","STRESSES"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":["Bioreactors","Cartilage, Articular\/cytology\/growth &amp","development","Chondrocytes\/cytology\/physiology","Tissue Culture\/methods","Tissue Engineering\/methods","Weight-Bearing\/physiology"],"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":["Algorithms","Animals","Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S","Cattle","Cell Division\/physiology","Cells, Cultured","Elasticity","In Vitro","Prostheses and Implants","Stress, Mechanical","Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"],"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":["Review","Review, Academic"],"D072B (Subject Category)":["LIFE SCIENCES (GENERAL)"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

But, in this work using a ductile nickel metal or an aluminum ultrafine particles, the FGM-blocks were easily prepared by powder metallurgy at a lower temperature. In the system Ni-NiO and Ni-Si3N4, a mixture of a metallic powder and a nonmetallic powder whose contents were gradually changed was pressed in a steel die under a pressure of 200-320 MPa. These green compacts were heated at 900-1573 K in controlled atmosphere under null pressure. In the case of Ni-AlN and Al-AlN systems, a compositionally gradient mixture of a coarse metallic powder and an aluminum ultrafine powder were pressed under 200 MPa in a steel die followed by heating at 873-1473 K in flowing nitrogen. In this process, the metallic ultrafine particle was reacted with nitrogen into metal nitride, but the coarse metallic powder did not react with nitrogen. Thus, the FGM-blocks of metal-metal nitride systems were completely accomplished.

{"D245A (Title)":"The Compressible Laminar Boundary Layer with Heat Transfer and Arbitrary Pressure Gradient","D520B (Abstract)":"An approximate method for the calculation of the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient, based on Thwaites' correlation concept, is presented. With the definition of dimensionless shear and heat-transfer parameters and an assumed correlation of these parameters in terms of a momentum parameter, a complete system of relations for calculating skin friction and heat transfer results. Knowledge of velocity or temperature profiles is not necessary in using this calculation method. When the method is applied to a convergent-divergent, axially symmetric rocket nozzle, it shows that high rates of heat transfer are obtained at the initial stagnation point and at the throat of the nozzle. Also indicated are negative displacement thicknesses in the convergent portion of the nozzle; these occur because of the high density within the lower portions of the cooled boundary layer.

The radiographic images were examined on a television monitor under various degrees of magnification and enhancement. The enhancement was accomplished by generating a video signal whose amplitude is proportional to the rate of change of density. Points, lines, edges, and other density variations that are faintly registered in the original image are rendered in sharp relief. Examples of the applications of this mode of enhancement are discussed together with the system's dynamic response and resolution.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["IMAGE ENHANCEMENT","MAGNIFICATION","RADIOGRAPHY","TELEVISION EQUIPMENT"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT","IMAGE CONTRAST","MATERIALS TESTS"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["INSTRUMENTATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}

{"D245A (Title)":"A Visual Editor in Java for Jview","D520B (Abstract)":"In this project we developed a visual editor in the Java programming language to create screens on which to display real-time data. The data comes from the numerous systems monitoring the operation of the space shuttle while on the ground and in space, and from the many tests of subsystems. The data can be displayed on any computer platform running a Java-enabled World Wide Web (WWW) browser and connected to the Internet. Previously a special-purpose program had been written to display data on emulations of PC GOAL screens. A new program to display data on the screens created by the new visual editor was written. The data viewer can be used in a WWW browser or as a stand alone program. It can connect directly to the data source, or it can connect indirectly through a proxy server. Our project shows the great flexibility of the approach. The unique relation between Java and the Internet makes our system easy to administer, update, and efficient. The good graphical user interface (GUI) library and networking library in Java make it easy to develop applications. Also, Java introspection was used to good advantage in the design of the visual editor. New components can be made available to the display designer without any modification to the editor.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE","JAVA (PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE)","WORLD WIDE WEB","SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS","APPLICATIONS PROGRAMS (COMPUTERS)","COMPUTER GRAPHICS"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["COMPUTER PROGRAMMING","INTERNETS"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":null,"D072B (Subject Category)":["COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND SOFTWARE"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}
{"D245A (Title)":"Laplace Transform Finite Element Method (LTFEM) for the Analysis of Contaminant Transport in Porous Media","D520B (Abstract)":"This paper develops a finite element method for the analysis of contaminant transport in porous media. The Laplace transform removes the time derivative and consequently the transformed equation contains only spatial derivatives. The transform equation is then approximated using the finite element method and solved to give the values of nodal variables in Laplace transform space. The actual solution in the time domain is found by numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. The actual solution in the time domain is found by numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. In this paper, the disadvantages of using complex arithmetic in the analysis of solute transport are overcome by using a numerical Laplace transform inversion technique due to Stehfest (1970) which uses only real arithmetic and thus provides a significant reduction in storage together with an increased efficiency of computation.","D650A (NASA Major Indexing Terms)":["LAPLACE TRANSFORMATION","FINITE ELEMENT METHOD","CONTAMINANTS","POROSITY","SOLUTES"],"D659A (NASA Minor Indexing Terms)":["INVERSIONS","COMPUTATION","DERIVATION","ARITHMETIC"],"D901A Non-NASA Primary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D902A Non-NASA Secondary Controlled Index Terms":null,"D653A Uncontrolled Index Terms":["CONTAMINANTS","POROUS MEDIA","FINITE ELEMENT METHOD","LAPLACE TRANSFORMATION","ENVIRONMMENTAL TRANSPORT"],"D072B (Subject Category)":["ENVIRONMENT POLLUTION"],"D359A (Authorized Users)":"Publicly available","D359C (Access Restrictions)":["Unlimited"],"Special Distribution Limitations":null,"Availabiliity Note":null}
